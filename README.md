👋 Hi, I’m Prisca, a **machine learning scientist and bioinformatician** passionate about applying mathematical and computational methods to solve complex problems in biology and medicine.  

I hold a **PhD in Biomedical Engineering (University of Bern)** and an **MSc in Mathematics (EPFL)**. Currently, I work as a **Data Analyst at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics**, where I design and evaluate ML/AI strategies for genomic datasets.  

My research and work experience bridge **deep learning, mathematics, and biomedical sciences**, with a focus on:  
- AI-driven biomedical imaging (3D U-Net, CNNs, GNNs)  
- Imaging and genomic data analysis and feature selection  
- Reproducible workflows and collaborative open science  
- Interdisciplinary projects between computational and biological domains
